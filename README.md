# The Shape Selecter - React version
The app gives you the name of the shape that has been selected. For now, only three shapes square, circle, and triangle have been used.

- The application uses React.
- Three Shapes available. Clicking on a shape gives the name of the shape being clicked.
- A click invokes a function call that determines the name of the shape based on the parameter `shapeName` passed to it. `shapeName` is assigned to the only variable in state `this.state.shapeName`. The value of `shapeName` is passed from `Shape.js` and is equal to respective string assigned to `shape`.
